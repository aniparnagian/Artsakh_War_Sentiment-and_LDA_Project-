GREAT LIARS\\nI did not want to tweet this during war time but the things I hear around me are horrible! Please let's stop putting differences between Local, Diaspora and Artsakh Armenians. \\nSpecially at a time when we should just all be one team.\\n@carlottagall @deanbaquet @nytimes I request a rewrite for this irresponsible and misinformed message. You completely omitted all the war crimes that Azerbaijan is committing by solely bombing civilian sites in Artsakh. #AzeriWarCrimes #PeaceforArmenians\\nhttps://t.co/Sv0ABEqwnC\\n@bmkhalife Artists who perform at “Artists for Artsakh” concert tonight support childkiller #Armenia who committed series of war crimes against #Azerbaijan killing almost 100 civilians.

Rrcognition of Artsakh  will stop ongoing war and will bring peace to the region.
